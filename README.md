# EX03--Change-the-third-person-character-mesh-and-add-animations
## Aim
To replace the default third person character mesh with a custom skeletal mesh and apply new animations using an animation blueprint.

## Procedure

1. *Import New Character Mesh and Animations:*
   - In the *Content Browser, import a new **Skeletal Mesh* along with its *Animations* (FBX files).
   - Ensure the mesh is rigged correctly (ideally to the UE4 Mannequin Skeleton or compatible with it).

2. *Replace Character Mesh:*
   - Open the *ThirdPersonCharacter Blueprint* (usually found in ThirdPersonBP/Blueprints).
   - Select the *Mesh* component.
   - In the *Details Panel, change the **Skeletal Mesh* to the newly imported mesh.

3. *Set Animation Blueprint:*
   - If available, assign a matching *Animation Blueprint* in the *Details Panel* under the *Animation* section.
   - If not available, create one:
     - Right-click in the Content Browser → *Animation → Animation Blueprint*.
     - Choose the correct skeleton.
     - In the AnimGraph, set up state machines or direct animation nodes.
     - Compile and save.

4. *Preview and Test:*
   - Place the character in the level.
   - Press *Play* to test idle, walk, and run animations based on character movement.

## Result
The default Third Person Character was successfully replaced with a custom skeletal mesh, and animations were applied using an Animation Blueprint. The character now visually reflects new assets and performs the desired movement animations.
